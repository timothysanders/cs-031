# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Data Science
- drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data sets
- uses exploration, prediction and inference
- Exploration: involves identifying patterns in information
  - Primary tools are visualizations and descriptive statistics
- Prediction: involves using information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew
  - Primary tools are machine learning and optimization
- Inference: involves quantifying our degree of certainty
  - Will patterns we found in data be found in new observations?
  - How accurate are predictions?
  - Primary tools are statistical tests and models
- Statistics and computing are central components of data science
  - Statistics: making robust conclusions based on incomplete information
  - Computing: programming allows us to apply analysis techniques to large/diverse data sets
### Introduction
- Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected via observation, stored on computer
- Computers allow us to infer properties from these descriptions
- Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation
- Three core aspects of effective data analysis
  - exploration
  - prediction
  - inference
- Data collected is usually an incomplete description of the subject at hand
- Challenge of data science is to make reliable predictions given this partial info
- Computation and randomization are essential tools for data science
- Computation
  - Allows us to use all available information to draw conclusions
- Randomization
  - Allows us to consider ways in which incomplete information may be completed
### Computational Tools
- Much of the data science community utilizes Python 3
### Statistical Techniques
- Statistics tends to address many of the same challenges as data science
  - "how to draw robust conclusions using incomplete information"
- Statistics has a consistent and precise vocabulary for describing the relationship between observations and conclusions
- Data science extends statistics by utilizing computing, data viz, machine learning, optimization, and access to information
### 1.2 Why Data Science
- Many important decisions are made without only partial info and uncertain outcomes
- Data driven decision-making can greatly benefit a number of industries and applications
- Data science allows individuals to bring large-scale data analysis to their work
- Many conclusions cannot be proven outright, but rather supported by available evidence (inductive reasoning)
- Important to be able to learn to reason about data and learn the tools & techniques to do so
### 1.3 Plotting the classics
- Computers can be used to analyze text/data at great speed

### Data Science / Data8
- What is Data Science?
  - Trying to learn and reason about the world using data and computation
  - Computation - manipulating data with code
  - Exploration
    - Identifying patterns in data
    - Uses visualizations
  - Inference
    - Conclusions from patterns observed in data
    - Using data to draw reliable conclusions about the world
    - Uses statistics
    - Refers to certain properties about individuals that you can already observe
  - Prediction
    - Making informed guesses about unobserved data
    - Uses machine learning
    - Refers to certain properties about individuals that you cannot observe
