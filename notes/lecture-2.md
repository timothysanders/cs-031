# Lecture 2: Cause and Effect

## Causality and Experiments
- Observation is key to good science
- *Observational study* is one where you make conclusions based on data observed, but not generated by the scientists
- A factor of interest is called a *treatment*
- An *outcome* is measured on each individual
- Fundamental question is whether a treatment has an effect on the outcome
  - Any relation between treatment and outcome is called an *association*
  - If treatment causes the outcome, the association is *causal*
- Establishment of causality often involves two stages
  - First, association is observed
  - Second, more careful analysis leads to decision about causality
### Observation and Visualization: John Snow and Broad Street Pump
- *Comparison* is used to identify an association between a treatment and an outcome
  - This compares the outcomes of individuals who got the treatment (treatment group) to the outcomes of those who did not (control group)
  - If results differ, then there is evidence of an association
  - This does not yet determine causation
### Snow's "Grant Experiment"
### Establishing Causality
- In an observational study, if the treatment and control groups differ in ways other than the treatment, it is difficult to make conclusions about causality
- Underlying differences between the two groups (other than treatment) are called *confounding factors*
- Confounding factors are common in observational studies
### Randomization
- A way to avoid confounding is to assign people to treatment/control groups *at random*
- Randomization keeps the two groups similar, apart from the treatment
- If you can randomize individuals into treatment/control group, you are running a *randomized controlled trial/experiment* (or RCT)
  - If people don't know which group they are in, that is a *blind* experiment
  - This can require a *placebo*, something that looks like the treatment, but doesn't do anything
- True randomization has to be carried out very carefully, following laws of probability
  - Methods can be as simple as a coin flip, or can be much more complex
- Randomization consists of a sequence of carefully defined steps
  - Allows us to account (mathematically) for possibility that randomization produces treatment/control groups that are quite different from each other
  - Allows us to make precise mathematical statements about differences between groups, which help determine if treatment has any effect
- Sometimes randomization is not possible, especially in situations where the treatment is not ethical

### Link and Association
- What is a "link" versus a "relationship"
- Link or association means two items that are moving together
- Observation (observing something that has already happened)
  - individuals: study subjects (humans, businesses, etc.), participants, units
    - For example, 336289 adults...
  - treatment
    - not necessarily medical, some sort of change or difference
  - outcome
- The first question
  - Is there any relation between chocolate consumption and heart disease?
    - association
      - any relation?
      - link?
    - There may be an association, but is it causal?
- A stronger link?
  - Compared to an "association"
- The next question
  - Does chocolate consumption *lead to* a reduction in heart disease?
    - This implies some sort of causal relationship
  - Causality
    - "something leads to something else"
    - "because of x, then y"
    - always implies association, but association does not imply causation
  - This is a harder question to answer 

### Association
- Miasma
  - Bad smell given off by waste and rotting matter
  - Believed to be the main source of cholera
- John Snow
  - Noticed that people in houses right next to each other weren't always having the same outcomes
  - Felt that symptoms might indicate different causes than "air"
  - Collected data and created visualizations to help map cholera deaths
    - Observational study
- "Correlation" is a way to measure association

### Causation
  - If you have two sets of people with only one variable that is different, you can potentially show causation
  - In general, you cannot prove causation with observational studies

### Comparison
- Treatment group
- Control group
  - Does not receive the treatment
- Key to establishing causality
  - If treatment and control group are similar apart from the treatment, then the differences in the outcomes in the two groups can be ascribed to the treatment
  - Treatment should be only fundamental difference

### Confounding
- If you have treatment and control groups with systematic differences other than the treatment, then it may be difficult to establish causality
- Such differences are often present in *observational studies*
- When they lead researchers astray, they are called *confounding factors*

### Randomize
- If you assign individuals to treatment and control *at random*, then the two groups are likely to be similar apart from the treatment
- Typically, don't want to tell participants which group they are in
  - blind (participant doesn't know) vs double-blind (participant and experimenter don't know) experiments
  - An example being patients receiving a covid vaccine vs a placebo vaccine
- Can account mathematically for variability in the assignment
- *Randomized Controlled Experiment*
- Randomization can help prevent confounding
- Generally hard to do randomized controlled experiments, because they can be unethical (especially in medical settings)
- In probability, random means something very specific
  - Does not mean "haphazard"
